You are provided with a directory containing a CSV file named 'users.csv'.

Your task is to identify all user records with invalid email addresses. An email is considered invalid if it does not contain exactly one '@' character and at least one '.' character after the '@'.

**Input:**
- The file 'users.csv' contains columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`.

**Output:**
- Your output should list the IDs of the invalid records in ascending order.
- You must produce results for EACH test case.

Output format:
case_01: INVALID_IDS: ...
case_02: INVALID_IDS: ...
case_03: INVALID_IDS: ...

Each line corresponds to one case directory.

**Constraints:**
- Do not modify the input file.
- Use Python and/or shell commands to solve the task.

**Validation:**
- A validation script will check if your output matches the expected invalid IDs.
Email Validation Rules (Benchmark Definition)

An email is considered VALID if and only if:

1. It contains exactly one '@'
2. The local part (before '@'):
   - is non-empty
   - contains only letters, numbers, dots, underscores, or hyphens
3. The domain part (after '@'):
   - does not start or end with '.'
   - contains at least one '.'
   - contains only letters, numbers, and dots
   - does not contain consecutive dots
4. No spaces are allowed

The task will be evaluated across multiple hidden test cases.
Your solution must generalize and not rely on hardcoded values.
